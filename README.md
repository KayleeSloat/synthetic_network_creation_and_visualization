# synthetic_network_creation_and_visualization
This project was based off of the publication, "NetProbe: A Fast and Scalable System for Fraud Detection in Online Auction Networks" by Shashank Pandit, Duen Horng Chau, Samuel Wang, Christos Faloutsos. This code allows the generation of an artificial network and then provides a visualization of the network.
